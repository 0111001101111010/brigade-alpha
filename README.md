Brigade Alpha
=============

Weâ€™ve started work on the [new Brigade website](http://brigade-alpha.codeforamerica.org). It is still very much a work in progress, yet we share early and often around here. The site at this repository is intended to eventually replace the [CfA Brigade site](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org).

We have a few main goals with this early prototype:

1. Clearly explain what the Brigade is.
2. Make it easy to find a local Brigade. The links on the map bring you directly to the Brigade's remote site.
3. An invitation to join that local Brigade. This join form uses the existing sign up logic from the main site that connects you to the local captain.

Install

Mostly, everything here is plain HTML. The app is run under Python Flask, which we will soon start using to host an actual database-driven API. But not yet.
